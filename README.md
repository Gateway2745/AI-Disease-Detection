# AI Plant Disease Detection

Identifying  diseases  is  a  crucial  step  in  the  agriculture domain as it impacts the cultivation and harvest of crops. In this project we automate the process of classification and localization of the Downy-Mildew Disease in Pearl Millets. 
<br />
This repository contains our work on image-based downy mildew detection in pearl millets using deep learning techniques. 
<br />
Commonly known as Bajra, pearl millets are a staple diet for many people in India. Efficient and timely detection of this disease can help increase the crop yield and help the farmers. We develop classification as well as detection models that are capabale of accuractely detecting the presence of this disease in the leaves and ears of the crop.
<br />
Our custom classification model with much fewer parameters outperformed the baseline model. YOLOv3, SSD and RetinaNet object detectors have been employed yielding promising results and a comparative analysis of their performance conducted. 
<br>
Images have been manually collected and annotated.

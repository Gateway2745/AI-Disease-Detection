# AI Plant Disease Detection

This repository contains my work on image-based downy mildew detection in pearl millets using deep learning techniques. <br />
Commonly known as Bajra, pearl millets are a staple diet for many people in India. Efficient and timely detection of this disease can help increase the crop yield and help the farmers. <br />
Specifically YOLOv3 and SSD object detectors have been utilized and a comparative analysis of their performance conducted. <br>
Images have been manually collected and annotated.
